# Divani Mods v1.1.2

**Thief steals Lovers; Ruthless tuning; placement delays for Portalmaker & Sentinel.**

Divani Mods 1.1.2 lets the **Thief** steal **Alliance** modifiers (including **Lover**), with optional **heartbreak** for the player who lost their partner. **Ruthless** gains a **Bypass First Death Shield** toggle (on by default). **Portalmaker** and **Sentinel** now use a **3-second placement delay** with the position locked when you press the button (like Sentry cameras). Portalmaker placement and **Use Portal** behaviour are also improved.

## Added

### Thief

- **Alliance modifier stealing:** The Thief can steal **Lover** and other Alliance modifiers from targets.
- **Lover pair rewiring:** Stealing **Lover** from one partner links the Thief to the other partner; the victim is no longer in the pair.
- **Stealing Lover Breaks Their Heart** (toggle, default **On**): After the pair is swapped, the player who lost **Lover** dies of **heartbreak** (end-game shows *Heartbroken* on all clients).

### Ruthless

- **Bypass First Death Shield** (toggle, default **On**): When enabled, Ruthless kills ignore the first-death shield; turn off to let that shield block Ruthless again.

## Improvements

- **Portalmaker:** **Place Portal** uses a **3s** channel; portals are placed where you stood when you clicked, not where you move during the delay.
- **Sentinel:** **Place Beacon** uses the same **3s** channel and **click-position** placement.
- **Portalmaker:** **Use Portal** button visibility and behaviour fixes.

## Bug fixes

- **Thief / Lover:** Stealing **Lover** no longer chains heartbreak deaths to the Thief or partner when only the old lover should die.
- **Thief / Lover:** Heartbreak cause of death and bodies now sync correctly for all players (not only the victim’s client).

## Known bug(s)

- Uses left on Sentinel is not always correct (visual bug).
- Previous Plague Doctor is not removed from the winners screen when **Amnesiac**
  inherits PD (Town Of Us end-game display).
