# Divani Mods v1.3.1
Town of Us versions after 1.6.2 now supported + Added Mage
## Added

### Added Role: Mage (Crewmate Power)

The Mage is a Crewmate Power role that has three spell abilities tied to one cooldown, either to help the crew or weaken the impostors

ABILITIES:
SHOCK SHIELD - applies a temporary shield on the target that deflects attacks
ENERGIZE - adds another ability use to crew roles and removes an ability use from evil roles
ILLUSION - makes the target temporarily invisible to all evil roles

### Added Modifier: Tactical Insertion (Universal Utility)

Mark your current position. After the next meeting you respawn at the marked spot instead of the meeting area.

## General changes

- Added support to newer versions of Town of Us Mira
- Added better checks for stuff visible if dead (now proper checks if dead for a round. Prevents revive cheese)
- Added a tool to make sure two modifiers cannot be assigned together and the counterpart cannot be stolen by thief or Sprout. Added for:
1.Tactical Insertion and Immovable
2.Incompetent and Skilled
- Added corresponding buttons to the role info in wiki under Abilities

## Bugfixes:


### Cunctator

- Fixed a bug where killing a Retributionist would still create a body after the delay.

### Duelist

- Fixed a bug which allowed duelist to reach it's win threshold earlier than intended

### Retributionist

- Fixed a bug where a Lover Retributionist being killed by its Lover teammate caused the Lover state to break. Now Killing your Lover teammate Retributionist will disallow the Retributionist to Revenge (because there is no one to revenge)

### Revenant

- Fixed a bug where Revenant was able to kill its impostor teammates. This can now only happen during Camouflaged Comms (if Kill anyone during Comms is enabled)


### UAV

- Fixed a bug where a UAV sees people in Duel. Duelers now also only only see it's opponent if the duel starts with an active UAV

## Role/Modifier Changes:

### Domesmith (Addition)

- Domesmith circles are now blue (no more confusion with Trapper)

### Plague Doctor (Nerf)

- Plague Doctor can now no longer become a Neutral Afterlife role if the setting to allow Plague Doctor to win while dead is enabled.

### Sentinel (Buff)

- Added a option to see the names of dead bodies if they were ever present in your room. This also still tracks a body even if it was cleaned/dragged after (default: false) 

### Ruthless (Refactor/Rework)

Ruthless' code has been cleaned to work in a more generic way. This changes the following:
- Pestilence is no longer killed by Ruthless killers (Nerf)
- Shield sources (Medic role holder etc.) now get alerted by the flash, even though their target still dies (Nerf)
- Veteran (And Mage Shock Shield) now make sure both the Ruthless attacker, as the Alerted shipmate, die (Buff)
- Mirrorcaster can now unleash after a Ruthless impostor killed the Magic Mirrored player
